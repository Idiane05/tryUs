Green Academy API Design
1. Introduction
The Green Academy API provides access to courses and student enrollments for an online environmental education platform. It is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and secure.

2. Resources
The main resources in this API are:

Courses
Represents available courses.
Attributes:
id: Unique identifier (integer).
title: Course title (string).
description: Course description (string).
instructor: Name of the instructor (string).
duration: Length of the course (string).
created_at: Timestamp when the course was added.
Enrollments
Represents student enrollments.
Attributes:
id: Unique identifier (integer).
student_name: Name of the enrolled student (string).
email: Student's email address (string).
course_id: The ID of the enrolled course (integer).
enrollment_date: Timestamp when the student enrolled.
3. API Endpoints
Resource	Endpoint	Method	Description
Courses	/api/courses/	GET	Get all courses
Courses	/api/courses/	POST	Create a new course
Courses	/api/courses/{id}/	GET	Get a specific course
Enrollments	/api/enrollments/	POST	Enroll a student
Enrollments	/api/enrollments/{id}/	DELETE	Cancel enrollment
4. Request & Response Structures
Create a Course (POST /api/courses/)
Request Body:

{
  "title": "Sustainable Farming",
  "description": "Learn about modern farming methods.",
  "instructor": "Diana Janny",
  "duration": "5 weeks"
}
5. HTTP Status Codes
200 OK: The request was successful, and the response body contains the requested data.
201 Created: A new resource was successfully created.
400 Bad Request: The request was invalid (missing fields, incorrect data format, etc.).
404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.
405 Method Not Allowed: The HTTP method is not allowed for the requested endpoint.
500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
6. Pagination
For endpoints that return a list of resources (such as /api/courses/), offset-based pagination will be used to limit the number of items returned per request. Clients can use page and limit query parameters to navigate through results.

Example Request:

GET Request: /api/courses/?page=1&limit=10

Example Response:

{
  "count": 50,
  "next": "/api/courses/?page=2&limit=10",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Sustainable Farming",
      "description": "Learn about modern farming methods.",
      "instructor": "Diana Jonny",
      "duration": "5 weeks"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Green Architecture",
      "description": "Explore eco-friendly building techniques.",
      "instructor": "Eric Jonny",
      "duration": "5 weeks"
    }
  ]
}
7. Personal Data Handling
The API will handle personal data such as student names, emails, and enrollment details. To ensure security and compliance with data privacy regulations, the following measures will be taken:

Data Encryption:

Personal data will be stored in the database in an encrypted format to protect it from unauthorized access.
Authentication and Authorization:

Only authorized users (e.g., admins) will be able to view, modify, or delete sensitive data.
Authentication will be implemented using OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure access control.
GDPR Compliance:

The API will allow users to access, modify, or delete their personal data.
Access: Users can request their personal data.

Modification: Users can update their personal information.

Deletion: Users can request deletion of their personal data.

By implementing these measures, the Green Academy API ensures compliance with data privacy regulations and safeguards user information.
